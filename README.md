Okay, I need to generate a README for the "Automatic Toll Manager" project based on the given code and requirements. Let me start by understanding the project first.

From the code snippets, it looks like an Arduino-based system using RFID to identify vehicles, deduct toll fees, and send SMS notifications via GSM. There's a servo motor for the gate, LCD for display, and EEPROM for storing balances. The user wants a project title under 50 characters, a detailed description without contribution or license info, a pin mapping section, and a note about diagrams possibly not being accurate.

First, the title. The project is named "11. Automatic Toll Manager" in the query, but the README should have a more concise title. Maybe "Automatic RFID-Based Toll Management System" fits within 50 chars.

Description needs to explain what the project does. It should mention the components: RFID for vehicle identification, GSM for SMS, LCD for display, servo for gate control. Also, how it checks balance, deducts fees, handles insufficient funds, allows balance top-up via buttons.

Pin mapping: Looking at the code. The LCD uses A1-A5 and A2 for some pins. The servo is on pin 9. The keys are on 4,5,6. RFID uses SoftwareSerial on 8 and 10, GSM on 3 and 2. I should list all those clearly.

Note about diagrams: The user wants a disclaimer if any diagrams are included, so I'll add a note stating they might not be accurate.

Don't include license or contribution sections. Also, list PDF files if any were provided, but the user listed "list of pdf files:" followed by nothing, so maybe just remove that part.

Now structure the README:

1. Title
2. Description
3. Features
4. Hardware Components
5. Pin Mapping
6. Code Overview (mention main files and functions)
7. Note on diagrams

Ensure that the provided code snippets are referenced, especially toll_manager.ino. Also, the EEPROM functions, GSM_init, send_SMS, servo control, and key inputs are important points to mention.

Need to check if the code uses any specific libraries, like SoftwareSerial, LiquidCrystal, EEPROM. Mention those in dependencies.

Wait, the user didn't ask for dependencies, but maybe include a "Dependencies" section since it's part of the project setup. But the user didn't specify, so maybe skip. The instructions said not to include contribution or license, but other sections? The user said "Provide a meaningful project title... detailed description... if possible include pinmap".

So focus on the main sections. Let's proceed.
# Automatic RFID-Based Toll Management System

## Description  
This project automates toll collection using RFID tags for vehicle identification and GSM for balance updates via SMS. The system features real-time fee deduction based on vehicle type (Bike/Bus/Car/Truck), LCD status display, servo-controlled gate mechanisms, and EEPROM-based balance storage. Administrators can adjust account balances directly via hardware buttons.

## Key Features
- **RFID Authentication**: Validates registered vehicle tags (5 pre-configured users).
- **Dynamic Toll Fees**: Charges ₹5 (Bike), ₹10 (Bus), ₹15 (Car), and ₹20 (Truck).
- **SMS Notifications**: Sends payment success/low-balance alerts via GSM module.
- **Gate Control**: Opens/closes toll gates using a servo motor after payment verification.
- **Balance Management**: Updates stored balances in EEPROM and allows manual adjustment via UI.

## Hardware Components
- Arduino Uno 
- RFID Reader (SoftwareSerial)  
- GSM Module (SIM800L)  
- 16x2 LCD  
- SG90 Servo Motor  
- Tactile Switches (for balance setup)
